## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    A mica sheet of 0.15 m diameter and 0.005 m thickness is subjected to heating using a 28 W power supply. Cold water is circulated around the specimen at a temperature of 30°C. Calculate the thermal conductivity of the specimen.
  </li>

  <li>
    Calculate the thermal conductivity and thermal resistance of a glass specimen with a diameter of 0.03 m and thickness of 0.1 m. A 37.4 W power is supplied to the heater, and cold water at 50°C is provided.
  </li>

  <li>
    A 45.6 W power is supplied to an asbestos cement board with a thickness of 0.006 m. Water at 60°C is circulated to protect the specimen, which has a diameter of 0.25 m. Calculate the thermal conductivity of the asbestos cement board.
  </li>

  <li>
    What happens to the thermal conductivity of a cardboard sheet of 0.16 m diameter and 0.008 m thickness when the power supply is increased from 57.2 W to 67.2 W? The cold water temperature is fixed at 0°C in both cases.
  </li>

  <li>
    An ebonite solid is selected as the specimen, with a diameter of 0.2 m and a thickness of 0.006 m. A 28 W power is supplied to a heater located at the center of the specimen. Cold water is circulated around the specimen at 100°C. Calculate its thermal conductivity and thermal resistance.
  </li>
